> 📁 A public repository of reusable KiCad hardware design blocks (MCU, SoC, sensors, SOM, power, etc.).

## 🚀 What is this?

**KiCad Open Hardware Blocks** is a modular, open-source reference library of complete hardware design units — designed to help engineers, educators and makers speed up embedded and electronic system development.

Each block is based on real-world, manufacturable PCB designs and includes:

- ✅ KiCad schematic  
- ✅ Routed PCB (v7.x and above)  
- ✅ BOM (with part numbers)  
- ✅ Fabrication files (Gerber, Drill)  
- ✅ Documentation and usage guidance

## 📦 First Block

🔹 **GD32VF103 MCU (RISC-V, SiBRAIN compatible)**  
A minimal but complete microcontroller core built around the open RISC-V architecture and compatible with Mikroe's [SiBRAIN standard](https://www.mikroe.com/sibrain).

More blocks coming soon.

## 🧱 Block Categories (aligned with @Mikroe)

- MCU / SoC  
- Connectivity  
- Power Management  
- Sensors  
- Actuators  
- Displays  
- Interfaces & Peripherals
